  <!-- A couple of paragraphs about yourself -->
  <p>
    I am a new Data Analyst, studied at USC Viterbi School of Engineering for the Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp. I used Python, Pandas, RapidAPI and Matplotlib to analyze member data.<br><br>
 
    I have senior-level, three years of experience with managing projects and working with different levels of colleges and clients to complete a project. 
    I used to work in a public accounting firm with the international tax group. It helped me develop strong managing and research skills on various tax laws internationally.<br><br>
     
    I am also a member of the machine learning studying group. Our goal is to learn more about machine learning, 
    build up different functions that can be used in our future career, and analyze data on our own. 
    We seek a different topic for every project to explore the unsupervised learning and supervised learning side of the machine learning.<br><br>
     
    I intend to continue doing hands-on data analysis, while developing additional technical and leadership skills.<br><br>
     
    Technical Skills: data analysis, Python, Pandas, Excel, VBA<br><br>
     
    Leadership Skills: training and mentoring, reviewing, communication, point of contact, project management<br>
